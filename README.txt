This repository is for purposes of hosting the code for the University of London 
BSc Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project. 

===========================================================
Contents of the repository:

The repository consists of a Jupyter notebook containing the primary project code as well as a 
folder `helper_func` which contains helper functions used in the notebook. The data for the project has been included as well under the folder `data`.

The data for the project has been included in the folder `data` but data/PUBHEALTH/train.tsv exceeded the 25MB filesize cap on Github but can be obtained from the zip folder at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eTtRs5cUlBP5dXsx-FTAlmXuB6JQi2qj/view. The full dataset can also be obtained at the links contained in the notebook introduction. 

===========================================================
How to use this project:
1. Download the project folder
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook Fake_News_Classification_in_Healthcare_March2023.ipynb using either Jupyter, Google Colab or VS Code's Jupyter extension.
3. Ensure the full dataset has been included in the folder data (see the caveat on data above).
4. Ensure dependencies are installed on your machine. The most challenging of these are tensorflow and keras. It is recommended to activate a virtual environment using either pip3 or anaconda. If you're using a Apple M1 Macbook then use miniforge, following the user guide in this link: https://makeoptim.com/en/deep-learning/tensorflow-metal
5. Run the cells within the Jupyter Notebook.
